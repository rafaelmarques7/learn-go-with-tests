# Learn Go with tests

This repo includes the source code that was created while following the [learn-go-with-tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) tutorial.

Notes: 
* The code is self documenting. When something is not obvious, the code includes comments that are intended to provide clarification. I believe that this will help to better understand the code when re-reading it.
* Lessons are organized into folders, because each folder can only have one package.
