Roman numerals

Roman numerals have the following rules:
* allowed symbols are: I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), M (1000)
* use "subtractive notation" (ex IV), which means that the first symbol (I) is subtracted from the larger one (V)
    * you can only use I, X, and C to subtract (ex: IX, XL, CM are valid numbers)
    * you can not subtract using V, L and D (ex: VX, DM are not valid numbers)
    * you can only subtract using the symbol 10 times smaller. For example, you can do XC, but not IC. You can do CM, but no XM.
* it is only possible to stack three equal symbols together. 
    * you can only stack I, X, C and M (ex: III, XX, CCC, MM)
    * you can not stack V, L, D (ex: VV or DDD is not allowed)
    * example: III and MMM is allowed, IIII and MMMM is not
    * this means that there is a maximum number allowed. That number is MMM CM D XC IX
* you can not add on subtractive quantities.
    * For example, you can not add V to IX. IXV is not a valid number. Same for adding D to CM, CMD is not a valid number.
    * But, XC is a subtractive quantity, and you can add to it. XCV is a valid number
    * It seems like the rule is "a subtractive quantity can only be followed by symbols 10+ times smaller"
        * CM can be followed by C, L, X, V, I
        * CD can be followed by L, X, V, I
        * XL can be followed by V, I
        * IV can not be followed by anything
